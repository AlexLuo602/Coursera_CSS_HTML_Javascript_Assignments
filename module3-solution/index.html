              Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
              I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
              She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her
              Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead

              Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
              Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
              Didn't make sense not to live for fun
              Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
              So much to do so much to see
              So what's wrong with taking the back streets
              You'll never know if you don't go
              You'll never shine if you don't glow

              Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
              Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
              (And all that glitters is gold)
              Only shooting stars break the mold

              It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
              You're bundled up now but wait 'till you get older
              But the meteor men beg to differ
              Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

              The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
              The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
              My world's on fire how about yours
              That's the way I like it and I never get bored
